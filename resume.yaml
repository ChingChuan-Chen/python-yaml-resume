about:
  My name is Jamal Chen. I am a data engineer and data analyst with 3+ years of experience in big data infrastructure,
  big data computation, data preprocessing, data visualization and modeling. I am an experienced R and MatLab programmer,
  also a experienced Linux user. Also, I am familiar with Spark in Python and Scala. I have experiences on Oracle SQL,
  Hive SQL and MongoDB. I am also familiar with SLURM and MPI. I can combine the multiple tools to develop a stable
  and fast system to provide analyzed results from billions of data for users. Therefore, user can response for the
  changing in processing in time and not to worry about that the data size crashes their computer and can not response in time.

    thesis: A Classification Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation with Subspace Projection
    advisor: Ray-Bing Chen
    abstract:
      For imbalanced data, the density ratio estimation (Kanamori et al. (2009)) is good solution
      to solve it. However, the performance of density ratio is poor when data is sparse in the
      high dimension. Therefore, we propose using projection to perform dimension reduction.
      Our result shows that the proposed method is better than the original method.

awards:
  - title: TSMC Kaggle Competition for the Defect Recognition
    date: December 2017
    awarder: Third Place
    description:
      A internal competition in TSMC. Its purpose is to make classification of defects able to judge automatically by machine for lessening human cost.
      They provides 3000 pictures of 4 types of defects and let employees fit a deep learning model to classify. Then send the model to the platform for
      get the accuracy rate of testing set (1200 pictures.).
  - title: Competition for Data Analysis with R in Taiwan
    date: August 2014
    awarder: Honorable Mention
    description:
      A national competition in Taiwan. Its purpose is to let participants find their own topic in given data and try to explain by data.
      The whole analysis need to be done by R. The data is collected from a registering system created by Taiwan governmet of the actual
