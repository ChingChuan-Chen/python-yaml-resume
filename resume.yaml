about:
  My name is Jamal Chen. I am a data engineer and data analyst with 3+ years of experience in big data infrastructure,
  big data computation, data preprocessing, data visualization and modeling. I am an experienced R and MatLab programmer,
  also a experienced Linux user. Also, I am familiar with Spark in Python and Scala. In some scenarios, I also write C++
  for performance. Except for programming languages, I have experiences on manipulating databases like Oracle, Hive and MongoDB.
  As for high performance computing, I am good at SLURM and MPI. Most importantly, I have a Master degree in statistics,
  so this is different to other data engineers. I am capable of linear regression with or without penalties and know the
  details of theorem. Therefore, I can realize from scratch. I also know about some clustering methods like K-means,
  Gaussian mixture model. For machine learning, I also study decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting tree model
  and I can apply them to do prediction in R. To sum up, I am an engineer who is capable of infrastructure,
  big data computing tolls and statistics.

    thesis: A Classification Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation with Subspace Projection
    advisor: Ray-Bing Chen
    abstract:
      For imbalanced data, the density ratio estimation (Kanamori et al. (2009)) is good solution
      to solve it. However, its performance shrink fast for sparse data. Therefore, we propose a
      projection method to perform the dimension reduction and make data more crowded to distinguish.
      Our result shows that the proposed method is better than the original method.

experiences:
  - organization: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited
    department: CIM Department
    location: Taichung, Taiwan
    position: Junior Engineer
    date: July 2016 - Present
    summary: Data engineer and data analyst in semiconductor manufacturing data.
    highlights:
      - I am assigned to survey, construct and maintain the first big data solution for our department. I used Apache Hive as data storage and
        Apache Spark as a tool to pull data from Oracle.
      - I developed an algorithm to detect the mean shift and variance shift on final WAT data.
        I also developed a fast computing procedure to get results in 1 hour for 100 million data via Hive and HDFS.
      - I used R to analyze billions of wafer-processing data to identify the key factors of yields.
        For example, I used gradient boosting tree model to find out the differences of history between bad wafers and good wafers by.
      - My colleague and me developed a correlation system to reveal the correlation between the thousands of measurements in time
        by SLURM, MPI and MongoDB. In this system, I took robust correlation instead of Pearson's one because there are
        many strange outliers which we cannot simply rule out in our data.
      - My colleague and me got the third place in a TSMC defect detection competition. My colleague and me customized a neural network model with
        two inputs. This model is based on Xception and Swish.
      - I manage infrastructure of R which based on CentOS 7 and responsible for writing packages including the frequently-used functions.

    department: Institute of Statistical Science
    location: Taipei, Taiwan
    position: Research Assistant
    date: September 2015 - June 2016
    summary: Functional data analysis of traffic data provided by Taiwan freeway bureau.
    highlights:
      - My main task is to improve the clustering and regression methods for functional data.
        It is based on functional principal component analysis.
      - I wrote an R program to schedulely scrawl data from websites with R and parse XML to store into MongoDB.
      - I used R shiny to build an interactive data visualization GUI for the highway data.
        It showes the daily traffic situation.
projects:
  - name: Automatically Generated Resume
    summary: A tool for automatically generated resume written in Python by YAML and Jinja2.
    url: https://github.com/ChingChuan-Chen/python-yaml-resume
    highlights:
      - Easily maintained resume by modifying the YAML file.
      - Themes are easily changed by using different Jinja templates.
  - name: R package RcppBlaze
    summary: Blaze is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic. This package provides the header files for linking Blaze library in Rcpp.
    url: https://github.com/ChingChuan-Chen/RcppBlaze
    highlights:
      - Full API from R to Blaze under the RcppArmadillo-like framework.
  - name: R package milr
    summary: This package performs maximum likelihood estimation for multiple-instance logistic regression utilizing EM algorithm with LASSO penalty.
    url: https://github.com/PingYangChen/milr
    highlights:
      - It is a first R package addressing the analysis of the multiple instance data.
      - This package provides a MLE with EM algorithm under the framework of logistic regression.
      - This package provides not only prediction, but also variable selection with L1 penalty.
      - The performance issues are solved by RcppArmadillo.

awards:
  - title: TSMC Kaggle Competition for the Defect Recognition
    date: December 2017
    awarder: Third Place
    description:
      A internal competition inside TSMC. The competition is to classify 4 types of defects from defect and referenced images.
      The score is accuracy rate on non-opened testing images. Our team used home-made neural network with 2 inputs for defect
      and referenced images, the model is based on Xception and Swish.
  - title: Competition for Data Analysis with R in Taiwan
    date: August 2014
    awarder: Honorable Mention
    description:
      A national competition for university and master students in Taiwan. Its purpose is to let participants find their own
      topic on a given dataset and try to explain their topic by data. The whole analysis was limited to use R.
      The data is collected from a registering system created by Taiwan governmet, the system contains the actual selling
      prices of real estate. Our team chose to predict the price of house from a messy data.
