    thesis: A Classification Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation with Subspace Projection
    abstract:
      To overcome the curse of dimensionality on density ratio estimation, we propose a methodology to
      perform dimension reduction. With several real dataset, our results show that the proposed
      method is better than the ones without dimension reduction.

        department: CIM Department
      - position: Data Scientist / Engineer

    target: Develop automation systems on quality control during wafer processing from a big volume of data (3 billions per day).
    projects:
      - project: WAT chart change detection
        role: data engineer / data scientist
        achievements:
          - WAT is wafer acceptance test which is examined when finishing the process of a wafer.
          - Common changing point analysis cannot be used in these data because there is no detailed orders in data. It only contains date information.
          - I propose a algorithm to detect the daily changes based on statistics.
          - It is effective to detect the changes between upper control limit and lower control limit.
      - project: control chart change detection performance improvement
        role: data engineer
        achievements:
          - It originally use Hadoop MapReduce to split data into csv stored in chart level, then implement R on each chart.
          - I propose to use MPI to accelerate the implementation time. I reduce the implementation time from 8 hours to 40 minutes.
          - The first key to reduce time is an algorithm to distribute the jobs with different running time which depends on data size.
          - The second key is to use MPI without memory limit instead YARN container with only 1GB memory.
            (Note that because we cannot change the memory size of YARN container.)
      - project: Build up a development environment for data scientist
        role: data engineer
        achievements:
          - Rely on Docker technology, we can provide a consistent and centralized controled development environment for data scientist.
          - I write a customized RStudio server Dockerfile to ensure everyone get the same environment.
      - project: Data pipeline for processing history data and measurements data
        role: organizer / data engineer
        achievements:
          - Done by Spark written in Scala and Python. (UDAF is written in Scala.)
          - Good design on job and provide multiple configurations for users.
          - Well monitoring for job implementation and data quality.
      - project: Propose, validate and construct a big data solution
        role: organizer / data engineer
        achievements:
          - For the messy data query requirement for data analysts, I tested several SQL-on-hadoop solutions to test.
          - Cassandra is unable to get data by different primary key.
          - It spend too much time on query for Drill.
          - Hive on Tez is chosen as our final solution.

        role: organizer / data engineer
        achievements:
          - Build a data pipeline to transform crawled data from XML to JSON and store them into a MongoDB.
          - Develop a platform to view the data with d3.js via R shiny.
      - project: Travel Time Estimation
        role: data scientist

    description:
      A internal competition in TSMC. There are over 100 teams to assist wafer factory decrease labor cost on the categorization of defects.
      There are only 3000 defect/reference images provided. The goal is do our best to get high accuracy rate on testing set (1200 images.).
      I used a 6-layer convolution nerual network with two Xception modules and win third place in 91.2% accuracy rate.

    date: 08-2014
    awarder: Honorable Mention
    description:
      A national competition in Taiwan. There are over 30 teams to do a brainstorming on the data from a system to register the actual selling price of real estate.
      Each team have one day to come out a topic, and apply R language to complete and demostrate the results.
      Our team chose to predict the price of house from the messy data via LASSO approach.
