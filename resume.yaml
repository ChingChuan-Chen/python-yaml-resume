    thesis: A Classification Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation with Subspace Projection
    abstract:
      To overcome the curse of dimensionality on density ratio estimation, we propose a methodology to
      perform dimension reduction. With several real dataset, our results show that the proposed
      method is better than the ones without dimension reduction.

        achievements:
          - WAT is wafer acceptance test which is examined while finishing the process of a wafer.
            There is no detailed orders in data. It only contains date information.
          - Proposed an algorithm to detect the daily changes based on statistics.
            It is effective to detect the changes between upper control limit and lower control limit.
          - Parallelly processed 3 billions records of data and output results of detections in 2 hours.
            It is done by R language and MPI.
      - project: Control chart change detection performance improvement
        role: data engineer
        achievements:
          - Proposed a new architecture powered by MPI to improve speed of detection algorithm.
          - Reduced the implementation time from 8 hours to 40 minutes in the new architecture.
          - Proposed an algorithm to dispatch the detection jobs with different running time which depends on data size.
      - project: Build up a development environment for the data scientists
        role: data engineer
        achievements:
          - Construct a consistent and centralized controled development environment for data scientist.
          - Writed a customized RStudio server Dockerfile to ensure everyone get the same environment.
      - project: Data pipeline for processing history data and measurements data
        role: organizer / data engineer
        achievements:
          - Propose a fast and reliable data pipeline powered by Spark in Scala and Python.
            (UDAF is written in Scala.)
          - Any new ETL can be set flexibly and easily for users. This UI is done by R shiny.
          - Well monitoring for job implementation and data quality.
          - Stored 6 billions data into Hive with full automation and good data quality.
      - project: Propose, validate and construct a big data solution
        role: organizer / data engineer
        achievements:
          - For the messy data query requirement for data analysts, I tested several solutions with SQL-like query language to test.
          - Tested several big data solution like Cassandra, Drill and Hive.
          - Made number of machine learning jobs can be done in 20 times shorter computing time than Oracle database.

      - project: Create a data streaming for researches (data from Taiwan freeway bureau)
        role: organizer / data engineer
        achievements:
          - Built a data pipeline to transform crawled data from XML to JSON and store them into a MongoDB.
          - Developed a platform to view the data with d3.js via R shiny.
      - project: Travel Time Estimation
        role: data scientist

      An internal competition in TSMC. There are over 100 teams to assist wafer factory decrease cost on the categorization of defects.
      There are only 3000 defect/reference images provided. The goal is do our best to get high accuracy rate on testing set (1200 images.).
      I used a 6-layer convolution neural network with two Xception modules and win third place in 91.2% accuracy rate.

    date: 08-2014
    awarder: Honourable Mention
    description:
      A national competition in Taiwan. There are over 30 teams to do a brainstorming on the data from a system to register the actual selling price of real estate.
      Each team have one day to come out a topic and apply R language to complete and demonstrate the results.
      Our team chose to predict the price of house from the messy data via LASSO approach.
