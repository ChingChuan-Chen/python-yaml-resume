    thesis: A Classification Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation with Subspace Projection
    advisor: Ray-Bing Chen
    abstract:
      For imbalanced data, the density ratio estimation (Kanamori et al. (2009)) is good solution
      to solve it. However, the performance of density ratio is poor when data is sparse in the
      high dimension. Therefore, we propose using projection to perform dimension reduction.
      Our result shows that the proposed method is better than the original method.

    location: Taichung, Taiwan
    position: Junior Engineer
    date: July 2016 - Present
    summary: Data engineer and data analyst on semiconductor manufacturing data.
    highlights:
      - Construct a big data solution for wafer manufacturing data by myself. The wafer manufacturing data is complex and multifarious,
        it contains the manufacturing history of wafer, measurements of production and control wafer and data collected from the detectors in tools.
        Therefore, how to design the data schema to store data in a big data and the time cost to query data are difficult. I try some sql-on-hadoop
        solutions to fit in our developing environment which uses SQL a lot. Finally, I use Apache Hive to store massive and messy data, and use
        Apache Spark to synchronize Oracle database and Apache Hive.
      - Build up R working environment, setup several Rstudio servers for developers, build up a mini-CRAN for those servers without network to get
        R packages installed, packing common function as several R packages like auto-install ROracle, Oracle SQL automatic build-up, graphic
        functions and Hive connector etc.
      - Analyze the semiconductor manufacturing data like offline/inline measurement, tool sensors or yield related issues.
      - Open R workshop to teach colleagues to use R more professionally and efficiently, introduct
        new R packages, and use R to perform machine learning and data analysis.
      - Construct R web service for other colleagues easily using R to generate graphs or perform machine learning without other knowledge.
      - Construct local git server powered by GitLab CE for the management of code, project in department.
      - Get 3rd place on the 1st TSMC Kaggle of classification of defect images by deep learning with our customized neural network.
      - Identifies the bad tools or key process with statistical methods.
      - Using statistical method to detect the shift of location or variance on the measurements.

    location: Taipei, Taiwan
    position: Research Assistant
    date: September 2015 - June 2016
    summary: Funcational data analysis of traffic data provided by Taiwan freeway bureau.
    highlights:
      - Automatically downloading open data from websites with R and parsing data in XML format for saving data to MongoDB.
      - Constructing the statistical method with MatLab and R.
      - Preprocessing data and analyzing the relationship between flow, speed and occupancy rate.
      - Building an interactive data visualization for the highway data with shiny in R.
projects:
  - name: Automatically Generated Resume
    summary: A tool for automatically generated resume written in Python by YAML and Jinja2.
    url: https://github.com/ChingChuan-Chen/python-yaml-resume
    highlights:
      - Easily maintain resume by modifying the YAML file.
      - Simply changing Jinja template for different themes.
  - name: R package RcppBlaze
    summary: Blaze is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic. This package provides the header files for linking Blaze library in Rcpp.
    url: https://github.com/ChingChuan-Chen/RcppBlaze
    highlights:
      - Full API from R to Blaze under the RcppArmadillo-like framework.
  - name: R package milr
    summary: This package performs maximum likelihood estimation for multiple-instance logistic regression utilizing EM algorithm with LASSO penalty.
    url: https://github.com/PingYangChen/milr
    highlights:
      - A first R package address the analysis of the multiple instance data.
      - This package provides a MLE with EM algorithm under the framework of logistic regression.
      - Providing not only prediction, but also variable selection with L1 panalty.
      - The performance issues are addressed by using RcppArmadillo.

awards:
  - title: TSMC Kaggle Competition for the Defect Recognition
    date: December 2017
    awarder: Third Place
    description:
      A internal competition in TSMC. Its purpose is to make classification of defects able to judge automatically by machine for lessening human cost.
      They provides 3000 pictures of 4 types of defects and let employees fit a deep learning model to classify. Then send the model to the platform for
      get the accuracy rate of testing set (1200 pictures.).
  - title: Competition for Data Analysis with R in Taiwan

    awarder: Honorable Mention
    description:
      A national competition in Taiwan. Its purpose is to let participants find their own topic in given data and try to explain by data.
      The whole analysis need to be done by R. The data is collected from a registering system created by Taiwan governmnet of the actual
      selling price of real estate. Our team chose to predict the price of house from a messy data. Each team had the times of a day to
      finish their report. We used half a day to clean data and visualize the data. Other half a day is used in modeling and writing report.
