    thesis: A Classification Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation with Subspace Projection
    abstract:
      To overcome the curse of dimensionality on density ratio estimation, we propose a methodology to
      perform dimension reduction. With several real datasets, our results show that the proposed
      a method is better than the ones without dimension reduction.

          - Propose a methodology to estimate the effects of variables via a regression model.
      - project: Data pipeline for processing history data and quality measurements data
        role: organizer / data engineer
        achievements:
          - Propose a fast and reliable data pipeline powered by Spark in Scala and Python.
            (UDAF is written in Scala.)
          - Any new ETL can be set flexible and easy for users. This UI is done via R shiny.
          - Good monitoring for job implementation and data quality.
          - Stored 6 billions of records of data into Hive with full automation and good data quality.
      - project: Propose, validate and construct a big data solution

      An internal competition in TSMC. There are over 100 teams to assist the wafer factory decrease cost on the
      categorization of defects. There are only 3000 defect/reference images provided. The goal is to do our best
      to get a high accuracy rate on testing set (1200 images.). I use a 6-layer convolution neural network with
      contains two types of the Xception modules and win third place in 91.2% accuracy rate.

    awarder: Honourable Mention
    description:
      A national competition in Taiwan. There are over 30 teams to do brainstorming on the data from a system to
      register the actual selling price of real estate. Each team has one day to come out a topic and apply the
      R language to complete and demonstrate the results. Our team chose to predict the prices of the houses
      from the messy data via the LASSO approach.
