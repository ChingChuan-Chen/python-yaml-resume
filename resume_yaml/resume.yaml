summary:
  description: |
    I am currently working as a senior data scientist in Trend Micro which is a global well-known cybersecurity company. My main mission is to analyze the network behaviors of IoT devices.
    Over the past three years, I design several systems of quality control for wafer manufacturing.
    The following summarised my major achievements:
  highlights:
    - Process over 6 terabyte data from multiple sources per day for the quality control systems.
    - Improve yield of product 10% by automatically discovering the dog tools.
    - Reduce 30% out-of-control rate with the regression model.
    - Reduce 500% scrapped products with a homemade change points detection algorithm.
    - Achieve a 93.5 percent accuracy rate in the defect recognization via a homemade CNN model    -

Packages:
  - name: RcppBlaze
    description: |
      I mimic the RcppArmadillo and RcppEigen to write this package to pack the Blaze for the R users.
      Blaze is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic.
      With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression Template implementation 'Blaze' combines the elegance
      and ease of use of a domain-specific language with HPC-grade performance, making it one of the
      most intuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available.
  - name: milr
    description: |
      I write all C++ code for the performance and most R code matching the operations in R stat package.
      The 'milr' package focuses on the predictive model for the multiple instance data set with binary
      outcomes and performs the maximum likelihood estimation with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm
      under the framework of logistic regression. Moreover, the LASSO penalty is attached to the likelihood
      function for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection.
